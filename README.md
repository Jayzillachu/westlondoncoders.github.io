West London Coders
====================

This is the repo for our website. Please feel free to make changes, add stuff and get familiar with Git and Jekyll. This is our site, so if you're on the team it belongs to you too.

The site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a static HTML generator. It's kind of like WordPress only faster and without the user interface.
