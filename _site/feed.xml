        <title>Hello WLC!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So this group grew a lot faster than I anticipated, which is great! Clearly there’s a demand for meetups in West London! I’m looking for an alternative venue for this Saturday (though still at Ealing Broadway), suggestions welcome - otherwise we’ll stick with Costa. Going forward, I’m aiming to host a meetup weekly but with no obligation for anyone to attend all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan is the same:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a teacher-led meetup, it will be something between a social and a hackday, where we can discuss and generate ideas and then (if we want to) build projects using front and back end skills. We can do this as a group or in small groups, whatever feels appropriate on the day. Otherwise we could also just chat and practice code in pairs. There are no expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also we have a Github organisation setup for the website and where we can start projects, if anyone wants to help out with that please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to seeing you all on Saturday or at a future meetup!&lt;/p&gt;
